Example 1:

Class Demo {

  public:
    Demo();
    ~Demo();
    print();
  private:
    int x;
};

Demo::Demo() {

}

Demo::~Demo() {

}

Demo::print(){


}

int main () {
  Demo d1;
  Demo d2;
  d1.print();
  d2.print();
}


The functions here (including constructor/destructor) are stored in common places, while object's member variable are stored in different memories.
I am imagining as of now that, d1 and d2 objects (member variables) are stored in stack.
